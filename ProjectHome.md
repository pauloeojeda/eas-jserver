This is an implementation of the EAS protocol, but on the server side. It is based on z-push, written in php.

I've tested it with Google (mail, calendar and contacts) as backend and two versions of Windows Mobile.

Allow to synchronize with google to  many devices wich runs EAS natively or via third-party applications
